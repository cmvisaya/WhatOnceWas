## Project Statement
**Cybersky Horizons** is a passion-project started in early 2024 by myself that spanned approximately two and a half months in development. It was my first attempt at an online multiplayer experience, and I think I did the game justice from an implementation standpoint with the vertical-slice that I had developed.
