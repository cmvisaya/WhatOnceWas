## Project Statement
**What Once Was** initially started as a class project in 2023. This project reaches far beyond the bounds of the class requirements, aiming to tie together the weekly projects into a profound, cohesive story. It was out of my comfort zone in the sense that I usually focus much more on mechanics rather than storytelling, but I believe I had done well to tell a simple, yet compelling story in the medium.
